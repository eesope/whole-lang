            Hello!

            Thank you for using whole-lang!

            You can add a new sentence via + button on home screen.
            You can swipe a sentence to edit or delete.

            And if you set a notification on a setting screen, whole-lang will send you a sentence randomly among your list once a day.

            Hope whole-lang could be useful!

            In case if you have any inqueries, please let us know through email.
            And it would be helpful if you add some informations such as... device model, OS version, etc.
